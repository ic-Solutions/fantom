  description: So I was recently accepted into the Walter Cronkite Covering the Rio Olympics program where we will be, you guessed it, covering the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August. It’s actually a pretty remarkable program if you think about it, and the opportunity itself provides so much for students. They sent students to cover the London Olympics in 2012, now they are tackling the the games on a much grander scale, and I am one of 24 students chosen out of 80+ applicants. So yeah, I’m pretty honored all things considering.

  description: Traveling is a really important part in my life and I love to get to know new cultures. It expands your box in which you’re living in. It changes your view of the world and life.Travel as much as possible! You will learn for life. You discover new cultures and get to know new people! The experiences will enrich your life and will make you happier (than any TV on earth)!
